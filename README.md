### 1. Check AQI_preprocessing.ipynb File where, we have preprocess the final AQI 19-23.csv file and add AQI as a target attribute after calculating it according to the Pakistan Standards
### 2. The compilation of AQI_preprocessing.ipynb creates a new file named as air_quality_with_AQI.csv
### 3. This new csv file then used in code file model_training_evaluation_and_evaluation.ipynb where we create different classical and deep learning models
### 4. Train these created models and then evaluate and compare to find the best performer model
### 5. Rest of the details are already provided in the above mentioned code files
### Note: To execute it in local environment / local system must install the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt file

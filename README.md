Check AQI_preprocessing.ipynb File where, we have preprocess the final AQI 19-23.csv file and add AQI as a target attribute after calculating it according to the Pakistan Standards
The compilation of AQI_preprocessing.ipynb creates a new file named as air_quality_with_AQI.csv
This new csv file then used in code file model_training_evaluation_and_evaluation.ipynb where we create different classical and deep learning models
Train these created models and then evaluate and compare to find the best performer model
Rest of the details are already provided in the above mentioned code files
